# Release 0.4.0

## Updates

- Added a "Passive Skill Tree", accessible from the **Abilities** screen, or by pressing **P**.

## Bug Fixes

- Dragging and dropping an equipped item back on the slot it came from wouldn't re-equip the item.
- The splash screen soundtrack wouldn't play while loading even if the window was focused.
