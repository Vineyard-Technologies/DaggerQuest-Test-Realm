                    <ul>
                        <li>Various performance improvements have been implemented.</li>
                        <li>Reduced the file size of <span class="name">DaggerQuest</span> by about half.</li>
                        <li>The <span class="name">Hitstun Threshold</span> stat has been renamed to <span class="name">Flinch Resistance</span>.</li>
                        <li>The <span class="name">Block Chance</span> stat has been renamed to <span class="name">Armor</span>.</li>
                        <li>Base <span class="name">Armor</span> has been reduced from 5 to zero.</li>
                        <li><span class="name">Armor</span>, <span class="name">Flinch Resistance</span>, and all the damage resistances use a formula with diminishing returns. The more of the stat you have, the less effective it is.</li>
                        <li>Having a shield equipped is no longer a requirement to successfully block.</li>
                        <li><span class="name">Kick</span> no longer can hit multiple enemies.</li>
                        <li>Reduced how much item mods scale with level.</li>
                        <li>Modified the formula that determines numerical values in item mods.</li>
                        <li>Reduced the attack speed of the <span class="name">Goblin Warlock</span>.</li>
                        <li>Player abilities no longer scale with level, and have had their values retuned.</li>
                        <li>Leveling up closes the ability selector.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="news-col-title">bug fixes</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sound effects with multiple variants would play some variants much less frequently than others.</li>
                        <li><span class="name">Kick</span> inflicted damage twice.</li>
                        <li><span class="name">Flinch Resistance</span> (formally known as <span class="name">Hitstun Threshold</span>) displayed incorrect values in the Character menu.</li>
                        <li>The <span class="name">Goblin Underling</span> could damage the player multiple times with his attack, in rare scenarios.</li>
                        <li>Player and enemy abilities would sometimes still do damage if the player or enemy died in the middle of using them.</li>
                        <li>Multiple door sound effects couldn't play at the same time, if multiple doors had been moused over.</li>
                        <li>Mods with very few possible numerical values didn't have a reduced chance at rolling a higher value.</li>
                        <li><span class="name">Leggings</span> didn't cast a shadow when equipped.</li>
                        <li>The player didn't obtain access to the correct abilities upon leveling up.</li>
                    </ul>
