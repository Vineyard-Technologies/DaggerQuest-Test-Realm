                    <ul>
                        <li>UI components have a fixed ordering, instead of putting the last component moved on top.</li>
                        <li>Updated the dialog of <span class="name">The Guide</span>, and added a second message.</li>
                        <li>Reduced music volume. This is a temporary solution until we add volume sliders in the Settings menu.</li>
                        <li>The distance with which an NPC can be interacted with is determined individually for each NPC, instead of being derived off of the player's pickup range.</li>
                        <li>Added coins, the currency of Ashladon. All items have a coin value, which appears in the mouse-over tooltips.</li>
                        <li>Added <span class="name">The Merchant</span> to <span class="name">Windmill Level 2</span>. You can sell your items to him, and buy back items that you've sold.</li>
                        <li>Color coordinated the menus for equipped items, and the inventory of players and merchants.</li>
                        <li>Enemies, loot, chests and NPCs no longer reset after leaving the area they are in and returning later.</li>
                        <li>The windmill fan sound effect plays while inside on <span class="name">Windmill Level 1</span> and <span class="name">Windmill Level 2</span>.</li>
                        <li>The enemy info mouse-over information fades in and out just like the rest of the interface.</li>
                        <li>The Settings menu is only available in-game, and no longer accessible from the main menu.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="news-col-title">bug fixes</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>UI components would be broken after going to a new area if they had been rearranged.</li>
                        <li>Picking up the tutorial loot, then leaving the area and coming back and picking up the tutorial loot again, would break most item functionality.</li>
                        <li>Clicking on an enemy while the player couldn't move would result in the player attacking that enemy, if that enemy later came near to the player.</li>
                        <li>The sizing of the header text in some locations was incorrect.</li>
                        <li>Menus would flicker when appearing or disappearing on low-end systems.</li>
                        <li>The necessary distance between the player and an NPC in order to initiate interaction wasn't isometrically correct.</li>
                        <li>NPC portraits obscured loot and item tooltips.</li>
                        <li>Dragging and dropping an item outside of the window would essentially destroy it.</li>
                        <li>Moving the mouse outside the window while dragging an item would cause the player to move toward the mouse location.</li>
                        <li>The sound effect for the basic attack and <span class="name">Heroic Strike</span> would still play if the player was stunned before the attack did any damage.</li>
                        <li>Ranged projectiles shot from the player that were already mid-flight would be destroyed if the player died.</li>
                        <li>The player's gear wouldn't become invisible if the player did.</li>
                        <li>Projectiles with audio that plays continually (like the buzzing of the <span class="name">Goblin Warlock</span>'s lightning orb) wouldn't stop playing immediately after changing areas.</li>
                        <li>Various control issues if the player's action speed was changed while they were currently stunned or blocking.</li>
                        <li>Key bindings could not be set if the player was stunned or blocking.</li>
                        <li>The player would switch to the idle animation after pausing, even when previously walking.</li>
                        <li>The player's action speed was affecting the speed of the idle animation.</li>
