### The official testing environment for *DaggerQuest*.

## üî¨ Test New Releases

**Access the Test Realm at: [Test.DaggerQuest.com](https://Test.DaggerQuest.com/)**

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

There can only be one GitHub Pages site per repository, so this repository was made to host the Test Realm.

`environmentRefresh.js` can be used to refresh this test environment to match the production environment, provided that repository is locally cloned as well.

The Test Realm may be updated and/or wiped without warning.
